# Next Greater Element I ‚Äì LeetCode Problem

## Problem Statement

Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`, find the **next greater element** for each element in `nums1` based on their position in `nums2`.

The **next greater element** of a number `x` in `nums2` is the first number to the right of `x` in `nums2` which is greater than `x`. If it does not exist, return `-1`.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Approach 1 ‚Äì Brute Force with `found` Flag

```javascript
function nextGreaterElement(nums1, nums2) {
    let result = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < nums1.length; i++) {
        let found = false;
        let nextGreater = -1;

        for (let j = 0; j < nums2.length; j++) {
            if (nums2[j] === nums1[i]) {
                found = true;
            }

            if (found && nums2[j] > nums1[i]) {
                nextGreater = nums2[j];
                break;
            }
        }

        result.push(nextGreater);
    }

    return result;
}
```

### ‚úÖ Explanation

- We loop through each element in `nums1`
- In the inner loop, we search in `nums2`:
  - Once we find the element (`found = true`)
  - We continue to look for the next greater element
- If we find one, we store it, otherwise, return `-1`

## ‚ö° Approach 2 ‚Äì Optimized with Clear `if-else` Logic

```javascript
function nextGreaterElement(nums1, nums2) {
    let result = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < nums1.length; i++) {
        let found = false;
        let nextGreater = -1;

        for (let j = 0; j < nums2.length; j++) {
            if (!found) {
                if (nums2[j] === nums1[i]) {
                    found = true;
                }
            } else {
                if (nums2[j] > nums1[i]) {
                    nextGreater = nums2[j];
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        result.push(nextGreater);
    }

    return result;
}
```

## ü§î Why Use Approach 2?

### 1. **Improved Readability**
- Clear separation of concerns:
  - First we **find the element**
  - Then we **look for the next greater**
- Easy to debug and understand

### 2. **Avoids Redundant Conditions**
- No need to repeatedly check `found && condition`
- Uses `if-else` to eliminate unnecessary logical evaluation

### 3. **Logically Efficient**
- Once `found` is `true`, it immediately switches to next task: finding greater

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n * m)**, where `n = nums1.length` and `m = nums2.length`
- For every element in `nums1`, we may scan all of `nums2`

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)** extra space (excluding the output array)
- We use constant space: `found`, `nextGreater`, and loop variables

---

‚úÖ **Summary:**

While both approaches work correctly, **Approach 2** is preferred due to its **clean control flow**, **reduced logical operations**, and **better maintainability**, especially useful as input sizes grow or when adapting the logic.

/* why it is */

In context of problems like "Next Greater Element":
It‚Äôs usually given that:


nums1 is a subset of nums2 and all elements are unique.
This guarantees:

You can safely search for each nums1[i] in nums2.

You don‚Äôt have to handle duplicates or missing elements.
