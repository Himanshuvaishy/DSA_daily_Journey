# ✅ DSA Revision Strategy

A step-by-step method to revise coding problems **effectively** — not just by remembering old solutions, but by building real understanding.

---

## 🔁 1. Read the problem again — from scratch
- Don’t look at your old solution yet.
- Read the question like it's your first time.
- Think: “If I never saw this before, how would I solve it?”

---

## 🧠 2. Start with a brute-force idea
- Try the most basic logic, even if it’s not optimal.
- Ask:
  - Can I use nested loops?
  - Can I use a Set, Map, Stack, etc.?

*Goal: rebuild logic from the ground up.*

---

## ✍️ 3. Write your own code
- Don’t reuse or copy old solutions.
- Type your own version from scratch.
- Even if it’s not perfect or optimal — just make it **work**.

---

## 🧪 4. Test with custom inputs
- Try 2–3 test cases manually.
- Dry run if needed (on paper or console.log).
- Think about edge cases:
  - Empty array?
  - Duplicates?
  - Negative numbers?

---

## ⚡ 5. Try to optimize
- Once your code works, think of improvements:
  - Can I reduce time/space complexity?
  - Is there a known pattern?
    - Two pointers
    - Sliding window
    - Binary search
    - Hash map
- Rebuild the solution with the better approach.

---

## 📝 6. Compare with previous solution
- Now look at your old solution (if available).
- Ask:
  - What’s different?
  - Did you miss something?
  - Which one is better?

*Learn, don’t just copy.*

---

## 🎯 7. Summarize in your own words
- Write 1–2 lines explaining your logic.
- Example:
  > “I used two pointers because the array is sorted. I skip duplicates by checking previous values.”

This builds long-term understanding.
